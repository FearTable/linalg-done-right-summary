\section{Null Spaces and Ranges}

\subsection{Null Space and Injectivity}

\begin{mydef} [null space, $\mynull T$]
  $\mynull T :\equiv \ker T :\equiv \{ v \in V \mid Tv=0\} \subseteq V$ for $T \in \lvw$
\end{mydef}

\begin{thm} [null space is a subspace]
  \label{thm: null space is a subspace}
  For $T=\linmap(V, W)$, $\mynull T$ is a subspace of $V$
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
  $0 \in \mynull T$ because $T(0) = 0$. Suppose $u,v \in \mynull T$ and $\lambda \in \myF.$ $\implies T(u+v)=Tu+Tv=0+0=0.$ Hence $u+v \in \mynull T$. We also have $T(\lambda u)= \lambda Tu = \lambda 0 = 0$, so $\lambda u \in \mynull T$.
\end{prf}

\begin{mydef} [injectivity]
  \label{def: injectivity}
  A function $T: V \to W$ is called \qt{injective} if
  \begin{equation}
    Tu = Tv \implies u = v \quad \forall u,v \in V
  \end{equation}
  Or analogous:
  \begin{equation}
    u \neq v \implies Tu \neq Tv \quad \forall u,v \in V
  \end{equation}
\end{mydef}

\begin{thm} [injectivity and null space property]
  \label{thm: injectivity iff null space equals zero-set}
  Let $T \in \linmap(V,W)$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    T $ is injective $ \iff \mynull T = \{0 \}.
  \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
  \qt{$\Rightarrow$ direction:} First suppose that $T$ is injective. We already know that $\{0\} \subseteq \mynull T$ because $\mynull T$ is a vector space by \ref{thm: null space is a subspace} or simply by using \ref{thm: linear maps take 0 to 0}. To prove that $\mynull T \subseteq \{0\}$, suppose $v \in \mynull T$. Then
  \[
    T(v) = 0 = T(0), $ because linear maps take 0 to 0 by \ref{thm: linear maps take 0 to 0}$.
  \]

  Because $T$ is injective, the equation above implies that $v=0$. Thus we can conclude that $\mynull T = \{0\}$, as desired.

  \qt{$\Leftarrow$ direction:} Now suppose $\mynull T = \{0\}$ and $u,v \in V$ \st $Tu = Tv$. Then
  \[
    0 = Tu - Tv = T(u-v).
  \]

  Thus $u-v \in \mynull T = \{0\}$. Hence $u-v=0$, which implies that $u=v$. We have shown that $Tu = Tv$ implies that $u=v$, hence $T$ is injective, as desired.
\end{prf}

\subsection{Range and Surjectivity}

% 3.16
\setcounter{thm}{15}
\begin{mydef} [range]
  $\operatorname{range}T :\equiv \{Tv \mid v \in V\} \subseteq W$ for $T \in \lvw$
\end{mydef}

% 3.18
\setcounter{thm}{17}
\begin{thm} [the range is a subspace]
  \label{thm: the range is a subspace}
  $T\in \linmap(V,W) \implies \myrange T$ is a subspace of $W$.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
  Let $T \in \linmap (V,W)$. Then $T(0)=0$ by \ref{thm: linear maps take 0 to 0}, which implies that $\boxed{0 \in \myrange T}\,$. So the additive identity $0$ is part of $\myrange T$.

  If $\boxed{w_1, w_2 \in \myrange T}\,$, then $\exists v_1, v_2\in V$ \st $Tv_1 = w_1$ and $Tv_2 =w_2$. Thus
  \[
    T(v_1 + v_2)=Tv_1 + Tv_2 = \boxed{w_1 + w_2 \in \myrange T}.
  \]

  Hence $\myrange T$ is closed under addition.

  If $\boxed{w \in \myrange T}$ and $\lambda \in \myF$, then $\exists v \in V$ \st $Tv = w$. Thus
  \[
    T(\lambda v) = \lambda Tv = \boxed{\lambda w \in \myrange T}.
  \]
  Hence $\myrange T$ is closed under scalar multiplication. Thus $\myrange T$ is a subspace of $W$ by \ref{thm: conditions for a subspace}.
\end{prf}

%3.19
\setcounter{thm}{18}
\begin{mydef} [surjectivity]
  \label{def: surjectivity}
  If $\myrange T=W$, $T:V\to W$ is called \qt{surjektive} or \qt{onto}.
\end{mydef}

\subsection{Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps}

% 3.21
\mce{21}
\begin{thm} [{\slshape \scshape Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps or ``Rank Nullity Theorem''}]
  \label{rank-nullity-theorem}
  \phantom{.} \\
  For $T \in \linmap(V,W)$, where $V$ is \fd, we have that $\myrange(T)$ is also \fd and
  \begin{equation}
    \dim V =
    \underbrace{ \dim\mynull T\phantom{g}\!\!\!\!\!}_{\text{nullity}}
    \; + \; \underbrace{\dim \myrange T}_{\text{rank}}.
  \end{equation}

  Note that $T \in \linmap(V,W)$ is not a typo.
\end{thm}
\begin{prf}
  Let $u_1, \ddd, u_m$ be a basis of $\mynull T$ with $\dim \mynull T = m$. Using \ref{thm: every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space}, this basis which forms a linearly independent inside $V$, can be extendend to a basis of $V$ which looks like this
  \[
    u_1, \ddd, u_m, v_1, \ddd, v_n
  \]

  Thus $\dim V = m+n$. To complete the proof, we need to show that $\myrange T$ is finite-dimensional and $\dim \myrange T = n$. We will do this by proving that $Tv_1, \ddd, Tv_n$ is a basis of $\myrange T$.

  Let $v \in V$ sucht that for $a_1, \ddd, a_m \in \myF$ and $b_1, \ddd, b_n \in \myF$:
  \[
    v= a_1 u_1 + \cdots + a_m  u_m + b_1 v_1 + \cdots + b_n v_n.
  \]

  If we apply $T$ we get $Tv=b_1Tv_1+ \cdots + b_nTv_n$. Since we can do this for every $v$, this implies that
  \[
    \myrange T = \myspan{Tv_1, \ddd, Tv_n} $ and that $\myrange T$ is finite dimensional.$
  \]

   To show what $Tv_1, \ddd, Tv_n$ is linearly independent, suppose $c_1, \ddd, c_n \in \myF$ such that
  \[
    c_1 Tv_1 + \cdots + c_n T v_n = 0.
  \]

  Then $T(c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_n v_n) = 0.$ Hence $c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_n v_n \in \mynull T$. Because $u_1, \ddd, u_m$ spans $\mynull T$, we can write
  \[
    c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_n v_n = d_1 u_1 + \cdots +  d_m u_m $ or$
  \]
  \[
  c_1 v_1 + \cdots + c_n v_n - d_1 u_1 - \cdots - d_m u_m = 0,
  \]

  where the $d$'s are in $\myF$. This last equation implies that all the $c$'s and $d$'s are $0$ because the $u$'s and $v$'s form a basis of $V$ and are therefore linearly-independent. Thus $Tv_1, \ddd, Tv_n$ is linearly independent and hence is a basis of $\myrange T$, as desired.
\end{prf}

  \begin{thm} [linear map to a lower-dimensional space is not injective]
    \label{thm: linear-map-to-a-lower-dimensional-space-is-not-injective}
    \phantom{.}\\
    If $\dim V$ $>$ $\dim W$ ^
    $\implies$ No \lm from $V$ to $W$ is injective.
  \end{thm}
  \begin{prf} Let $T\in \linmap(V,W)$ such that $\dim V > \dim W$. Using \ref{rank-nullity-theorem}, we have
    \begin{equation}
      \dim \mynull T = \dim V - \dim \myrange T \geq \dim V - \dim W > 0,
    \end{equation}
    The first inequality follows from \ref{thm: dimension of a subspace}, because $\myrange T$ is a subspace of $W$. The second inequality is because we assumed $\dim V > \dim W$. Now the equation tells us that $\dim \mynull T > 0$. Thus $T$ is not injective by \ref{def: injectivity}.
  \end{prf}

  \begin{thm} [linear map to a higher-dimensional space is not surjective]
    \phantom{.}\\
    If $\dim V < \dim W$ $\implies$ No \lm from $V$ to $W$ is surjective.
  \end{thm}
  \begin{prf}
    Let $T\in \linmap (V,W)$ such that $\dim V < \dim W$. Then
    \begin{equation}
      \dim \myrange T = \dim V - \dim \mynull T \leq \dim V < \dim W
    \end{equation}
    Thus we have $\dim \myrange T < \dim W$. So $\myrange T \neq W$. Thus $T$ is not surjective by \ref{def: surjectivity}.
