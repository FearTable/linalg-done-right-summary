\begin{mydef} [list, length]
  A list of length $n$ is the same as an $n$ tuple. We write a list of vectors of length $m$ of vectors $(v_1, \ldots, v_m)$ as $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ throughout this document without closing parentheses.
  Since lists are the same as tuples, two lists are only equal if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order.

\begin{mydef} [$\myF^n,$ coordinate]
  $\myF^n :\equiv \left \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \mid x_k \in \myF, \; k \in \{1, \dots, n\} \right \}$
