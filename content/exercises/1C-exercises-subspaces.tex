\begin{xrcs}
  Prove that the union $U \cup W$ of of two subspaces $U, W$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ $\iff$ one of the subspaces is contained in the other. So $U\subseteq W$ or $W \subseteq U$.
\end{xrcs}
\begin{prf}
  \qt{$\Leftarrow$ direction:} Let $U$ and $W$ be two subspaces of $V$. If $U \subseteq W$ then $U \cup W = W \subseteq V$ and if $W \subseteq U$ then $U \cup W = U \subseteq V$.

  \qt{$\Rightarrow$ direction:} We can prove this either directly or by contradiction. In both proofs, lets assume that $U \cup W$ is a subspace of $V$ given that $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$ as well. \\
  \prooffont{Proof by contradiction:} Suppose $U \subsetneq W$ and $W \subsetneq U$. Note that this would imply that $U \neq \{0\}$ and $W \neq \{0\}$. Therefore we have that
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
    \exists u \in U: u \notin W \myand \\
    \exists w \in W: w \notin U.
  \end{aligned}
  \]

  Since $u,w \in U \cup W \implies u+w \in U \cup W $ we have that either $u+w \in U$ or $u+w \in W$ (or both).
  \begin{description}
    \item{\prooffont{Case $\mathbf{u+w \in U:}$}} In this case, let $\widetilde u :\equiv u + w \in U$. Hence $w = \widetilde{u} - u \in U$, a contradiction.
    \item{\prooffont{Case $\mathbf{u+w \in W:}$}} Let $\widetilde w :\equiv u + w \in W$. Hence $u = \widetilde{w} - u \in W$, again a contradiction.
  \end{description}

  So the assumtion that $U \subsetneq W$ and $W \subsetneq U$ can not hold. So the opposite is true. By de Morgan's rule it must hold that $U \subseteq W$ or $W \subseteq U$.

  \prooffont{Direct proof:} We have $2$ cases. $W \subseteq U$ or $W \subsetneq U$. If $W \subseteq U$, then the disjunction \[
  W \subseteq U $ or $ U \subseteq W
  \]
  is automatically true. So lets assume that $W \subsetneq U$ and prove that this implies that $U \subseteq W$.
  Let $u \in U$ and $w \in W \backslash U$. By the definition of union, it also holds that $u,w \in U \cup W$. Since $U \cup W$ is a subspace of $V$:
  \[
    u+w \in U \cup W.
  \]

  By the defintion of union, there are two possible cases. $u+w \in U$ or $u+w \in W$. The first case would imply
  \[
    w = (u+w) + (-u) \in U,
  \]

  which is impossible. Hence $u+w \in W$ and therefore
  \[
    u= (u+w) -w \in W
  \]

  Since $u$ was arbitrary, $U \subseteq W$.
\end{prf}
