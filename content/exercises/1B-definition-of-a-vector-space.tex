\section*{Exercises about Definition of a Vector Space}

%1
\begin{xrcs}
  Prove that $-(-v) = v \quad \forall v \in V$.

  \begin{xprf}
    Let $v \in V$. By definition, we know that $v + (-v) = 0$. We also know by definition, that the additive inverse of $(-v)$, which is unique by \ref{thm: unique additive identity}, is denoted by $-(-v)$. The first equations shows that $-(-v) = v$, making $-(-v) + (-v) = 0$.
  \end{xprf}
\end{xrcs}

%2
\begin{xrcs}
  Suppose for $a \in \myF$ and $v \in V$ we have $a \cdot v = 0$. Prove that $a=0$ or $v=0$.

  \begin{xprf}
    There are two cases for $a$. Either $a=0$ or $a\neq 0$. If $a=0$, we are done. If $a \neq 0$, then
    \[
    av=0 \iff \tfrac{1}{a}(av)=\tfrac{1}{a}0 \iff \left(\tfrac{1}{a} \right)v = 0 \iff v = 0.
    \]

    So either $a=0$ or $v=0$.
  \end{xprf}
\end{xrcs}


%3
\begin{xrcs}
  Suppose $v,w \in V$. Explain why there exists a unique $x \in V$ such that $v + 3x = w$.

  \begin{xsol}
    To solve this equation for $x$, we first need to subtract $v$ from $w$ and aftwewards devide by $3$. The additive inverse of $v$ is unique. But also the result of multyplying a vector by a number is unique.
  \end{xsol}
\end{xrcs}

\begin{xrcs}
  \prooffont{Solution:} The only requirement for a vector space the empty set fails to satisfy is the existence of a additive idenity.
\end{xrcs}

\begin{xrcs}
  Show that in the definition of a vector space, the additive inverse condition can be replace with the condition that
  \[
    0v = 0 \quad \forall v \in V.
  \]

  \begin{xprf}
    By the distributive properties we get $\forall v \in V:$
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
      0 = 0v &= (1 + (-1))v
      &= 1v + (-1)v
      &= v + (-1)v
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    So $\forall v \in V: 0= v + (-1)v$ means that for every $v$ we have an additive inverse $(-1)v$.
  \end{xprf}
\end{xrcs}
